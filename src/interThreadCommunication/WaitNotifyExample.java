//ðŸ§µ wait() and notify() are core tools in inter-thread communication in Java.

//ðŸ“¦ What is Inter-Thread Communication?
//Itâ€™s when multiple threads coordinate or communicate with each other using shared objects â€” often to:
//Wait for a condition to be met (like a buffer being filled).
//Signal other threads to continue execution.
