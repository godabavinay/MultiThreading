// üßµ Producer-Consumer Problem: A Quick Recap
// Producer thread(s) generate data and place it in a shared buffer.
// Consumer thread(s) take data from the buffer and process it.
// The shared buffer has limited capacity, making synchronization essential.

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Core Challenges

// 1. Race Conditions
// When multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently without proper synchronization, inconsistent or corrupted data may result.

// üìç Example:
// Producer writes a value to buffer.
// Before it marks the buffer as full, the Consumer reads it ‚Äî possibly reading invalid or incomplete data.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Use synchronization (e.g., synchronized, Lock) to make operations atomic.

// 2. Buffer Overflow (Overproduction)
// If the producer is faster than the consumer and the buffer is full, it must wait, or data will be lost or overwritten.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Producer must check if the buffer is full, and if so, call wait() or block until there's space.

// 3. Buffer Underflow (Overconsumption)
// If the consumer is faster than the producer and the buffer is empty, it must wait ‚Äî otherwise, it reads invalid data or throws exceptions.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Consumer must wait if buffer is empty and be notified only when data is available.

// 4. Thread Synchronization
// Proper coordination is needed to avoid:
// Two producers writing at the same time.
// One consumer reading while another is removing the same item.
// Deadlocks and starvation.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Use mutexes, monitors, or higher-level concurrency primitives.
// Carefully structure wait()/notify() inside synchronized blocks.

// 5. Deadlock
// Occurs when:
// Producer is waiting for consumer to consume,
// And consumer is waiting for producer to produce,
// But neither releases the lock.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Avoid nested locks and always use while(condition) wait() instead of if().

// 6. Spurious Wakeups
// Threads waiting on wait() might wake up even without a notify() due to JVM optimizations.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Always check the condition in a while loop, not if.

// 7. Fairness & Starvation
// If notify() always wakes the same thread (e.g., one consumer), other threads (e.g., producers) may starve.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Use notifyAll() when fairness is needed, or use BlockingQueue which handles fairness better.

// 8. Busy Waiting (Without Proper Waiting)
// Inefficient designs might make the producer/consumer loop continuously checking the buffer in a tight loop.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Use proper blocking mechanisms (wait(), sleep(), or BlockingQueue), not manual spinlocks.

// 9. Difficulty Scaling with Multiple Producers/Consumers
// As more threads are added, coordination becomes harder.
// Bugs like deadlocks, race conditions, and lost signals become more likely.
// üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
// Use well-tested concurrent data structures like BlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, or ReentrantLock + Condition.

// ‚úÖ Summary Table
// Challenge	        Cause	                           Solution
// Race Condition	    Concurrent unsynchronized access   Use locks/synchronized
// Buffer Overflow	    Producer too fast, buffer full	   Wait when buffer full
// Buffer Underflow	    Consumer too fast, buffer empty	   Wait when buffer empty
// Deadlock	            Circular waiting	               Avoid nested locking, use while
// Spurious Wakeups	    JVM optimization	               Use while not if
// Starvation	        Unfair scheduling or wrong notify  Use notifyAll() or fair locks
// Busy Waiting	        Manual spin checks	               Use wait(), sleep(), or blocking queues
// Scaling Issues	    Many threads and shared resources  Use concurrent collections
